## 📝 Recent Updates

> Showing the 10 most recent updates. For the complete changelog, see [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md).

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2026-09-12 10:15:00 | v1.6.40 - 🔍 Fixed the model-test page rendering real errors as "No response content" (issue #11 follow-up): a streaming failure can only be expressed as an in-stream error frame, and the frontend never read that key — so 503/529/500/400 all looked identical. It now shows the real reason and status code, and content already streamed is preserved. Account cards now expose real health info (`is_healthy` / consecutive failures / last success time / a redacted last error) — the green ACTIVE badge reads the pool's status enum, not the client's health flag, so an account with a dead cookie still showed green. Empty responses are no longer silently recorded as success (3 in a row before they count as errors; a single one never downgrades an account). Startup now logs whether the cookie-rotation loop actually started |
| 2026-09-01 16:20:00 | v1.6.39 - ⚙️ `LOG_BODIES_ENABLED` is now a toggle in the admin panel's new "Logging" group — takes effect instantly, no config edit or restart (still off by default); ⚠️ Behavior change: settings saved from the panel now persist to `data/settings-overrides.json` and **take priority over environment variables** (previously a panel change was silently reverted on restart); fixed float fields being silently truncated by `parseInt`, rejected NaN/±Infinity, and made a failed write roll back all three layers (memory / overrides file / .env) atomically; filled in panel labels that rendered as raw field names or hardcoded Chinese, with guard tests |
| 2026-09-01 13:10:00 | v1.6.38 - 🍪 Fix same-name cookies coexisting across domains (when Google redirects you to a country domain such as .com.hk) aborting session-token acquisition and wrongly marking the account unhealthy (issue #10 follow-up; also a real trigger of the issue #11 wedge); a malformed tool-call JSON now triggers one automatic regeneration (with stream keepalive during the retry); new opt-in full request/response logging `LOG_BODIES_ENABLED` (off by default, memory-only — never written to disk — and no request headers recorded) |
| 2026-08-30 18:20:00 | v1.6.37 - 🩺 Fix the account pool wedging permanently and mis-reporting "All accounts busy" (issue #11): an account whose session expired made every request wait the full 60s and return a bogus 529; it now fails fast with an accurate 503 and **automatically attempts a cookie reload to self-heal**; a client disconnect is no longer counted as an account failure (three Stop clicks could kill a single-account pool); a failed cookie reload no longer permanently downs a healthy account |
| 2026-08-28 19:40:00 | v1.6.36 - 🚨 OpenAI streaming no longer disguises upstream errors as a successful answer (a standard `error` frame is emitted so SDK clients raise and can retry); finer error types for upstream 4xx; the Anthropic `citations` field is now consistent between streaming and non-streaming; a non-string `content` no longer causes a 500 |
| 2026-08-28 17:30:00 | v1.6.35 - 🛠️ Protocol-conformance and robustness overhaul: fixed image-intent false positives that **silently dropped client tools** (shared by all four protocols), upstream errors masquerading as normal answers, `HTTPStatusError` escaping as bare 500s (pool-exhausted now 529 + Retry-After), missing keepalive on the `/v1/responses` and native-Gemini buffered branches, the native Gemini router rejecting the official SDK's camelCase payloads, OpenAI `tool_calls` being dropped, the third-party Anthropic forwarder breaking tool loops after round 1, and Anthropic response-shape conformance (no more non-standard image block or null noise) |
| 2026-08-28 15:10:00 | v1.6.34 - 🧹 Anthropic protocol polish: responses now include the spec's `stop_sequence` field (documented across all five API docs); a null tool-call `name` no longer renders as the Python literal None; the disconnect keepalive guard now retrieves task exceptions; plus hardened tests for the tool rendering format and disconnect cancellation |
| 2026-08-28 14:20:00 | v1.6.33 - 🔌 Fix Claude Code connectivity (issue #10): `system` now accepts the text-block array form (no more 422); `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks are no longer dropped (agent tool loop works); Anthropic streaming now emits the standard `event:` + `data:` frames; plus keepalive on the Claude buffered stream and prompt account-slot release on client disconnect |
| 2026-08-14 22:50:00 | v1.6.32 - 🧠 Stream reasoning frame-by-frame: native Gemini's thinking now streams incrementally as reasoning_content during generation (/v1/chat/completions), so it appears before the answer with a typewriter effect, fixing the panel's 'answer before thinking'; the final frame still carries full thoughts as a safety net; zero regression for non-thinking/normal chat |
| 2026-08-14 22:40:00 | v1.6.31 - 🌊 Fix intermittent streaming disconnects: send keepalive heartbeats during the silent gap while the model generates, across all four streaming APIs (/v1/chat/completions, /v1/responses, /v1/messages, native Gemini streamGenerateContent), so long responses aren't cut by cross-border/gateway idle timeouts; also reworded the misleading panel network-error copy |

## 🌟 Core Features

> 📖 Detailed usage guide: [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)

### 🔌 Triple Protocol Compatibility

- Single service provides OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini SDK formats simultaneously
- SSE streaming (OpenAI / Claude) + Chunked JSON (Gemini)
- Function calling supported across all three formats
- Deep Research multi-step research capability

### 🔐 Security & Authentication

- Auto-generated API Keys (`sk-` prefix + 32 random characters)
- Supports both `Authorization: Bearer` and `x-api-key` authentication
- Auto-generated on first deployment, customizable by users

### 🔄 Multi-Account Load Balancing & Cookie Self-Healing

- **Multi-account load balancing**: Supports round-robin and failover strategies
- Per-account concurrency control prevents single account overload
- Automatic health marking for failed accounts, auto-skip unhealthy ones
- Background cookie rotation for seamless renewal
- Hot-update Cookie API without container restart
- Dynamic account add/remove via API
- Health check history for web panel data support

### 🛡 Anti-Detection & Protocol Spoofing

- **TLS fingerprint consistency**: UA, Sec-Ch-Ua, curl_cffi impersonate always synchronized (Chrome 124)
- **Dynamic request headers**: Arranged in Chrome's real order, dynamically adjust Sec-Fetch-* based on request type
- **Complete cookie persistence**: Auto-capture all response cookies and persist to disk across restarts
- **Cookie domain isolation**: Clear session cookies before each request to prevent cross-domain conflicts
- **Chrome version auto-sync**: Poll Google version API every 24 hours, auto-update fingerprint on new version
- **Request time jitter**: Simulate human operation intervals (navigation 200-800ms / API 50-300ms / cookie rotation 1-3s)
- **Version fallback strategy**: Auto-use nearest available version when curl_cffi doesn't support latest Chrome

### 🖥 Web Management Panel

- Chinese visual management interface with API Key authentication
- Top-right control bar: theme toggle, service restart, logout
- Dashboard: real-time uptime counter, QR code cards (image zoom support), system info (version/Python/OS/memory/CPU/PID/mode), config management, account status overview, available models list
- **Hot-update resources**: `api/` directory volume mount, QR code images and text config changes take effect on page refresh without container rebuild
- Account management: add/delete accounts, update individual cookies, health checks
- **Settings page**: visual runtime config management (performance, rate limiting, health checks, account management), changes take effect immediately
- **Model mapping**: map request model names to actual models (e.g., gpt-4o → gemini-2.5-pro)
- **API Key management**: centralized third-party model API Key management (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/OpenRouter/custom), import/export support
- Playground: online API testing
- Real-time logs: structured table display, direction filter, text search, pagination (15 per page), JSON detail panel, disk persistence (survives restart)
- Dark/light theme toggle, responsive mobile adaptation

### 🔀 Unified Forwarding Engine

- Auto-forward requests for models not in Gemini Web's available list to matching Provider from API Key pool
- Direct OpenAI-compatible format forwarding (including streaming), bidirectional Anthropic conversion
- `/openai/v1/models` auto-aggregates Gemini Web models + third-party models from API Key pool
- Single interface, single key to call all major models
- Third-party auto-fallback (`FALLBACK_ENABLED`, off by default): when any Gemini model errors or returns an empty response, automatically retry natively with a third-party model from the API Key pool — transparent to the client, still using just one model name; by default automatically uses all "chat-capable" third-party models in the pool (excludes non-chat models such as image/video), random round-robin, switching to the next on failure; `FALLBACK_MODELS` optionally specifies them precisely

### ⚡ High-Performance Architecture

- Python asyncio + curl_cffi, fully non-blocking pipeline
- Chrome TLS fingerprint spoofing + auto version tracking, significantly extended session lifetime
- Pydantic strong type validation, automatic request parameter validation
- Modular design, independent routing files for each API format
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

## 📋 System Requirements

| Dependency | Version | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Python | 3.12+ | Recommended 3.12, older versions untested |
| Docker | 20.10+ | Optional, Docker deployment recommended |
| Google Account | — | Must have normal access to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com) |
| Browser | Chrome / Edge | For cookie extraction (deployment only) |

> [!TIP]
> Docker deployment requires no local Python installation, just Docker and valid cookies.

---

## ⚡ Quick Deployment

> 📖 Detailed deployment guide: [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)

> **Prerequisite**: You need a Google account with normal Gemini access.

### 1. Get Cookies

1. Open Chrome or Edge browser and visit [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
2. Log in with your Google account and verify Gemini works normally
3. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
4. Click the **Application** tab at the top
5. In the left sidebar, find **Cookies** -> click `https://gemini.google.com`
6. Find these two values in the cookie list:

| Cookie Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `__Secure-1PSID` | Long string starting with `g.`, typically dozens of characters |
| `__Secure-1PSIDTS` | Shorter string |

7. Recommended to operate in incognito mode, close the window immediately after getting values to avoid cookie rotation issues

> [!TIP]
> Search for `__Secure-1P` in the search box for quick filtering. Double-click the Value column to copy the full value.

> [!WARNING]
> Cookies expire over time. If the service suddenly stops working, check if cookies have expired first.

### 2. Docker Deployment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/xwteam/gemini2api.git
cd gemini2api

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file and add your cookies:

```env
GEMINI_PSID=g.a000xxx...(paste your full __Secure-1PSID value)
GEMINI_PSIDTS=sidts-xxx...(paste your full __Secure-1PSIDTS value)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Important notes:
> - Values don't need quotes
> - No extra spaces or newlines
> - Ensure you copy the complete value, don't miss the end

Start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check logs to confirm successful startup:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
# "Account pool ready: 1/1 active" means account pool is ready
# "SNlM0e not found" means cookie is invalid, need to get new one
```

### Multi-Account Configuration (Optional)

To use multiple Google accounts for load balancing, create `accounts.json`:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "account-0",
      "psid": "g.a000xxx...",
      "psidts": "sidts-xxx...",
      "label": "Main Account"
    },
    {
      "id": "account-1",
      "psid": "g.a000yyy...",
      "psidts": "sidts-yyy...",
      "label": "Backup Account"
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Without `accounts.json`, the service automatically uses single-account mode from `.env`. You can also dynamically add accounts via `POST /admin/accounts` API at runtime.

### Cookie Auto-Keep-Alive

gemini2api has built-in cookie auto-rotation: refresh `__Secure-1PSIDTS` every 5 minutes via Google RotateCookies API, combined with batchexecute heartbeat to simulate browser activity and extend session lifetime.

To manually update cookies, use the Web panel's "Account Management" → "Update Cookie" without restarting the service.

> [!NOTE]
> Cookie lifetime is affected by Google's risk control policies. Datacenter IPs typically last several hours. If cookies expire frequently, consider using residential IPs or adding more accounts for rotation.

### 3. Verification

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5918/health
# {"status":"ok","service":"gemini2api"}

# View available models (requires API Key, check logs on first startup)
curl http://localhost:5918/openai/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key"

# Send test request
curl -X POST http://localhost:5918/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key" \
  -d '{"model":"gemini-2.0-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

Seeing AI response text means deployment succeeded. If you get 401, check your API Key.

## 🧪 Integration Examples

> [!NOTE]
> All API requests require an API Key. Two authentication methods supported:
> - `Authorization: Bearer sk-xxx` (recommended, compatible with OpenAI/Claude SDKs)
> - `x-api-key: sk-xxx`
>
> API Key is auto-generated on first startup and written to `.env`, visible in logs or manually editable.

## ⚙ Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Settings changed in the panel take precedence over environment variables.**
> Anything you save on the web panel's Settings page is written to
> `data/settings-overrides.json` (`data/` is the persistent bind mount used by
> docker-compose) and replayed on every startup, **overriding** the corresponding
> environment variable in the table below. This is deliberate: once you turn
> `LOG_BODIES_ENABLED` off in the panel, `docker compose restart` must not turn it
> back on.
>
> So if you **edited `.env`, restarted, and nothing changed**, that field is most
> likely overridden by the panel. The startup log names the affected fields:
> `Applied N panel setting override(s) from data/settings-overrides.json: ...`.
> Delete `data/settings-overrides.json` to hand control back to the environment.

| `FALLBACK_ENABLED` | ❌ | `false` | Enable Gemini → third-party fallback: when any Gemini model (flash/pro/thinking) errors or returns an empty response, automatically retry natively with a third-party model from the API Key pool |
| `FALLBACK_MODELS` | ❌ | — | Fallback models (comma-separated, tried in order); empty = automatically use all "chat-capable" third-party models in the pool (excludes non-chat models such as image/video/audio/embedding by name) with random round-robin, switching to the next one whenever one fails (errors or empty) |

## ⚠ Important Notes

1. **Cookie Expiration**: Google cookies expire periodically (typically hours to days). The service has built-in auto-refresh, but if your account is logged out or password changed, you need new cookies.

2. **Streaming Output**: All API endpoints stream by default. When `stream: false`, the service still receives streaming data internally and returns complete JSON after collection.

3. **Model Availability**: Available models depend on your Google account permissions. Free and Gemini Advanced accounts see different models. The service auto-detects on startup.

4. **Request Frequency**: Even with rate limiting disabled (`RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false`), Google has its own limits. High-frequency requests may trigger CAPTCHAs or temporary bans. Control request frequency appropriately.

5. **Network Environment**: The deployment server must have direct access to `gemini.google.com`. Some regions may need proxy configuration.

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [x] OpenAI / Claude / Gemini triple format compatibility
- [x] Streaming responses + function calling
- [x] Deep Research multi-step research
- [x] Docker deployment
- [x] API Key authentication
- [x] Cookie hot-update API
- [x] Scheduled account health checks
- [x] Multi-account rotation (load balancing)
- [x] Web management panel
- [x] Anti-detection & protocol spoofing
- [x] Settings page (visual config management)
- [x] API Key management (third-party model keys)
- [x] Unified forwarding engine (single interface for all models)
- [x] Model mapping (alias → actual model)
- [x] Auto-cleanup of accumulated web sessions (periodically delete old sessions, keep pinned)
- [ ] Image/file upload support
- [x] [issues #2](https://github.com/xwteam/gemini2api/issues/2) Custom Gemini Gem support (panel list / create / update / delete + expose as a model name)
- [x] [issues #6](https://github.com/xwteam/gemini2api/issues/6) [#7](https://github.com/xwteam/gemini2api/issues/7) Native Gemini extended thinking (enable via `reasoning_effort`; reasoning streams frame-by-frame before the answer + "Thinking" toggle in the Playground panel + one-click off, never affects normal chat)
- [x] Gemini fallback toggle in API Management (instant on/off with persistence, no .env edit or restart needed)
